----

This is a charsheet template made in google sheets, offering you these nice benefits:

- Powerful formulas form the box.
  You don't have to re-calculate everything whenever you level up or take a debuff,
  the sheet will do everything for you.
- Flexibility and versatility.
  This sheed doesn't pretend to be an app, it has no locked ranges or strict rules
  on how to use it. If you find any functionality missing, or doesn't fit your purposes,
  just edit it, or maybe even delete all the formulas and fill the data yourself.
- Good documentation, which includes UI and formulas.

If you like spreadsheets but don't want to waste days creating your own,
this is a good point to start!
